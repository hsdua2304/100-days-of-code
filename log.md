### Day 5: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue my JavaScript course on udemy, Implemented the likes controller. Also, did the JavaScript30 challenge till date I have completed 4 projects in 2 days. Today, I learned the Array functions such as sort(), filter(), reduce(), map().

**Thoughts:**: My JavaScript course is consuming my too much of time because of the very low API usage I am not able to complete the project. its good I have also started the JavaScript30 along with this and I am utilizing my time properly.
